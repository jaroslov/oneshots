The Ruiners
===========

The world has magic, but not spells. Any intelligent being with sufficient
access to a reliable magical library can build a magical artifact. Over the
eons, many magicians (wizards; warlocks; witches) have done so --- artifacts
that would bewilder the mind; amaze the masses; terrify the good and the bad.

Unfortunately, making an artifact is much easier than keeping the artifact;
villains, mishap, and the simple march of time will all undo even the
greatest of wizards.

Character Creation
------------------
A character has four attributes:

+ Fierceness  -- strength, willpower, ferocity in a fight
+ Finesse     -- dexterity, control, fine manipulation
+ Intuition   -- street smarts, savviness, the uncanny ability to 'get it right now'
+ Theoretics  -- book study, knowledge, the ability to understand the long game

Each attribute --- for a human --- ranges from 3 to 18. Roll 3D6 for each
attribute (randomly). Attributes are used to determine if a character can complete a
task under difficult or extenuating circumstances. An attribute can be used to
inform the player about their character, if the player wants. However, a
character is not fundamentally described by their attributes. That is, consider a
character with a low finesse score: the character may be graceful at all times,
*except* under duress.

The character's attribute bonus is their attribute divided by 3 (rounded down),
minus 3. The following table precomputes the bonus for human-range values:

| Attr | Bonus | Attr | Bonus | Attr | Bonus | Attr | Bonus |
|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|------|-------|
|  3   |  -2   |   7  |  -1   |  11  |   0   |  15  |   2   |
|  4   |  -2   |   8  |  -1   |  12  |   1   |  16  |   2   |
|  5   |  -2   |   9  |   0   |  13  |   1   |  17  |   2   |
|  6   |  -1   |  10  |   0   |  14  |   1   |  18  |   3   |

Skills
------

Skills are grouped by the attribute check they can apply to:

+ FIR/FIN
    Acrobatics
+ FIR/INT
    Lockpicking (physical security)
+ FIR/THE

+ FIN/INT

+ FIN/THE

+ INT/THE


Using attributes
----------------

Attributes are used during attribute checks: to determine if a character is
able to perform an action while under duress. Use the following mechanism for
attribute checks:

1. Determine which attribute bonus applies to the check;
2. Apply any one skill bonus, as appropriate;
3. Apply an circumstantial modifiers;
4. The total is the attribute check value:
    > Attr Check := Attribute bonus + Skill Bonus + Circumstance Modifier
5. Roll 1D20;
6. If the value of the roll plus the attribute check is above 15,
   then the roll succeeds.
